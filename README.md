# The argument for supplementation
- Vitamin D reduces the risk of [other](https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583) acute respiratory infections. One interesting finding of this meta-analysis is that people who were very deficient (less than 25 nmol/L) saw the largest protective effect with an adjusted odd ratio of 0.58 and a 95% CI of 0.40 to 0.82. These are the same populations which seem to be at risk for severe Covid-19.
- Calcitriol, the active form of Vitamin D [is active](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.162396v1) against the SARS-COV2 virus.
- A [Mendelian randomisation analysis](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/20/bmjnph-2020-000096) of excess COVID-19 mortality of African-Americans in the US suggests that vitamin D is a risk factor for Covid Mortality
- Several studies have now observed lower vitamin D levels among severe Covid-19 patients
- [Vitamin D is very low risk](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0265/v1) an adverse events of vitamin D supplementation can be easily managed by clinicians


# Direct research on vitamin D and Covid

### Evidence of a causal link
- A [Mendelian randomisation analysis](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/20/bmjnph-2020-000096) of excess COVID-19 mortality of African-Americans in the US suggests that vitamin D is a risk factor for Covid Mortality

### In vitro evidence
- Calcitriol, the active form of Vitamin D [is active](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.162396v1) against the SARS-COV2 virus.

### Covid severity associated with serum vitamin D levels

#### Post-infection blood samples

*Supports vitamin D link*

- A re-analysis of [107 Swiss blood samples](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/5/1359/htm) found that PCA positive patients had 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations half that of PCA negatives. This finding held after stratifying for age and gender.
- A [restrospective study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3571484) in the Philippines found a significant association between vitamin D status and severe Covid-19 infections.
- Hospitalized male Covid-19 patients [were found](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20079376v1) to have lower vitamin D levels than controls
- A observational [study from Belgium](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20079376v2) found that vitamin D deficiency is correlated with the risk for hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia and predisposes to more advanced radiological disease stages.
- Vitamin D deficiency [was more common](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.20136903v2) among ITU Covid patients than the general population in a Newcastle hospital.
- A [Mexican study](https://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/sanmil/sm-2020/sm201_2za.pdf) found that patients with vitamin D serum levels bellow 8 ng/mL had 3.68 higher risk of dying from COVID-19.

#### Pre-infection blood samples
*Supports link to vitamin D*

- A [retrospective cohort](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095893v1.full.pdf) study found that Chicago patients who were likely vitamin D deficient were more likely to test positive for Covid-19.
- An [Isreali study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.20144329v1.full.pdf) of 7,000 patients with pre-Covid serum vitamin D tests found that vitamin D levels were associated with Covid infection and hospitalization.

*Contradicts vitamin D link*

- Vitamin D levels between 2006-2010 [were associated](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301156) with Covid-19 mortality, but not after controlling for other variables in the data set. It's hard to make inferences from 10 year old blood samples because there's a causal story in which low vitamin D in 2010 _increases_ vitamin D in 2020 because that group is likely to supplement.


### Intervention studies
- A [small cohort trial](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.20112334v1) found that just 16% of patients who received vitamin D, magnesium, and vitamin B12 required oxygen compared with 61.5% of the previous cohort who did  not receive DBM supplementation.


### Ecological studies
- A study out of [Northwestern University](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058578v3.full.pdf) found that the vitamin D status of a country's elderly population was associated with the number of severe cases of Covid-19 in that country.
- There was a [strong correlation](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.20138644v1) between vitamin D levels and European mortality which increased over time.
- UVB radiation, which the skin uses to manufacture vitamin D is [associated](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3586555#.XrA5awDBBLE.twitter) with lower death rates and case fatality rates.
- Covid-19 deaths-per-million appears to [vary by latitude](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311755).
- Latitude [was not associated](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/early/2020/05/08/cmaj.200920.full.pdf) with a proportional increase in cases during one week of March.
- Latitude is a significant predictor of Covid mortality after [controlling for age](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/06/14/bmjnph-2020-000110).

# Lit reviews and clinical guidance
- [This review](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0265/v1) of potential vitamin D mechanisms of action provides some useful history on the origin of vitamin D dosing recommendations. They also review their clinical guidelines after treating several thousand patients with 5000-10000 IU/day, including recognizing and resolving  hypercalcemia or other adverse events.
- [Slovenia](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1820/rr) has begun administering vitamin D to residents of nursing homes and health care workers.
- A [review in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0661-0) suggests that all patients should be monitored and potentially treated for vitamin D deficiency. 
- A [bmj report](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/15/bmjnph-2020-000089) which is generally critical of the connection between Covid-19 and vitamin D nevertheless concludes that supplementation according to government health guidelines (no more than 4,000 IU/day) is sensible for most people. 
- Evidence supports a [vitamin-D causal model](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087965v1) more than an acausal one.
- A quarantine hospital in Egypt has [started providing](https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/88198/Doctors-in-Egypt%E2%80%99s-quarantine-hospitals-to-receive-million-Vitamin-D) vitamin D to frontline medical workers. 
- The French National Academy of Medicine now [recommends](http://www.academie-medecine.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20.5.22-Vitamine-D-et-coronavirus-ENG.pdf) vitamin D supplementation as a preventative and adjuvent therapy for Covid-19 infection.
- NICE, an English clinical research group, [does not recommend](https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/es28/chapter/Key-messages) vitamin D supplementation.
- A [review of the evidence](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/bmjnph/early/2020/05/13/bmjnph-2020-000089.full.pdf) finds that supplementing with vitamin D in accordance with government guidelines is a good idea, but there is no evidence to support supplementation rates higher than 4,000 IU/day


# Vitamin D / Covid correlations
- Vitamin D deficiency is [very common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856111) in places that have been hit hard by the disease.
- Vitamin D reduces the risk of [thrombosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4069050/) which is one of the [puzzling symptoms](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01403-8) of Covid-19
- People with the genetic condition [phenylketonuria](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00195.2020) tend to consume a diet fortified with vitamin D, and anecdotally have not suffered any Covid-19 deaths. 
- Hypocalcemia [was associated](https://t.co/zBGyptVwaz?amp=1) with covid-19 severity. Vitamin D deficiency is one cause of hypocalcemia. 


# Race and Covid
- [Black and Asian](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999v1.full.pdf) populations are at a high risk of Covid morality. [Some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067096/) have found a relationship between skin pigmentation an vitamin D levels, but [others](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1306357) have found that there is no difference in bio-available vitamin D because of differences in genetic polymorphisms related to vitamin D–binding protein. Interestingly, vitamin D binding protein is [itself associated](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/65/5/456) with infectious lung diseases.
- There are [lots of other factors](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31102-8/fulltext) which vary by race and which make Covid mortality more likely. These do not fully explain the race gap.
- BAIPO, which represents UK doctors of Indian origin [wrote to the NHS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zU3yT7wE8folyKUmIX6NbIg2K3P6ffUD/view) advocating for vitamin D testing and supplementation for front line staff. They are providing all members with vitamin D on request.
- Black people are [5 Times More Likely](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.20101691v1) to Develop COVID-19: Spatial Modeling of New York City ZIP Code-level Testing Results
- Excess African-American mortality in the US [was higher](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/20/bmjnph-2020-000096) in southern states than northern states.
- A dataset of [6 million US veterans](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099135v1) found that Black and Hispanic had higher rates of Covid-19 which were not explained by medical conditions or where they live or receive care.
- [An analysis](https://su.figshare.com/articles/Socio-demographic_risk_factors_of_COVID-19_deaths_in_Sweden_A_nationwide_register_study/12420347) found that immigrants to Sweden from low and middle income countries were 1.5-2.5 times more likely to die from Covid.
- [An analysis of census](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27407#fromrss) data found that for all minorities, the minority's population share is strongly correlated with total COVID-19 deaths.


# MIS-C, PIMS-TS, Kawasaki Disease
- Kawasaki disease was weakly associated with vitamin D supplementation [at birth](https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-019-1438-2) and KD patients had [lower levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25994612/) of vitamin D. There is [an association](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/191/4/499/937208) with Covid-19 and a syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease in children.
- BAME children at at a [higher risk for PIMS-TS](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1548/rr-25) in Paris and London. 
- Black and Latino children [were overrepresented](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2021680?query=featured_home) in American MIS-C cases.

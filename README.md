# Direct research on vitamin D and Covid

- A re-analysis of [107 Swiss blood samples](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/5/1359/htm) found that PCA positive patients had 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations half that of PCA negatives. This finding held after stratifying for age and gender.  
- A [restrospective study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3571484) in the Philippines found a significant association between vitamin D status and severe Covid-19 infections.
- An [Indonesian](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3585561) study of 712 people found that after controlling for age, gender, and co-morbidity, vitamin D deficiency was associated with a twelve times higher risk of death.
- Hospitalized male Covid-19 patients [were found](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20079376v1) to have lower vitamin D levels than controls
- A study out of [Northwestern University](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058578v3.full.pdf) found that the vitamin D status of a country's elderly population was associated with the number of severe cases of Covid-19 in that country.

# Vitamin D / Covid correlations
- Vitamin D deficiency is [very common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856111) in places that have been hit hard by the disease.
- Vitamin D reduces the risk of [thrombosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4069050/) which is one of the [puzzling symptoms](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01403-8) of Covid-19
- Kawasaki disease was weakly associated with vitamin D supplementation [at birth](https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-019-1438-2) and KD patients had [lower levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25994612/) of vitamin D. There is [an association](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/191/4/499/937208) with Covid-19 and a syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease in children. 

# Race and Covid
- [Black and Asian](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999v1.full.pdf) populations are at a high risk of Covid morality. [Some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067096/) have found a relationship between skin pigmentation an vitamin D levels, but [others](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1306357) have found that there is no difference in bio-available vitamin D because of differences in genetic polymorphisms related to vitamin Dâ€“binding protein. Interestingly, vitamin D binding protein is [itself associated](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/65/5/456) with infectious lung diseases.
- There are [lots of other factors](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31102-8/fulltext) which vary by race and which make Covid mortality more likely. These do not fully explain the race gap.

# Supplementation in the absence of evidence

## Latitude and UVB radiation
- UVB radiation, which the skin uses to manufacture vitamin D is [associated](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3586555#.XrA5awDBBLE.twitter) with lower death rates and case fatality rates.
- Covid-19 deaths-per-million appears to [vary by latitude](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311755).
- Latitude [was not associated](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/early/2020/05/08/cmaj.200920.full.pdf) with a proportional increase in cases during one week of March. 
- Latitude [was associated](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087965v1) with the severity of local Covid outbreaks by one measure of severity. 

# Potential Mechanisms

- Vitamin D helps regulate the [renin angiotensin system](https://youtu.be/Nfp4X4O87DQ?t=1499) which includes the ACE2 receptor that Covid-19 binds to.
- Vitamin D [may bind](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0084/v1) to the  non-structural protein nsp7 on the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

# Vitamin D background
- Vitamin D reduces the risk of [other](https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583) acute respiratory infections. One interesting finding of this meta-analysis is that people who were very deficient (less than 25 nmol/L) saw the largest protective effect with an adjusted odd ratio of 0.58 and a 95% CI of 0.40 to 0.82. These are the same populations which seem to be at risk for severe Covid-19.

# Studies I don't know what to do with
- Vitamin D levels between 2006-2010 [were associated](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301156) with Covid-19 mortality, but not after controlling for every other variable in the dataset. I don't know what to do with this study because there's a causal story in which low vitamin D in 2010 _increases_ vitamin D in 2020 because that group is likely to supplement.
